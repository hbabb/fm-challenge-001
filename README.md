## Challenge Details

This challenge was to build a QR code component that closely matches the given design. It involves creating responsive layouts for both mobile and desktop views.

### Design Files

The design specifications include:

- **Static JPGs** for mobile and desktop versions.
- A style guide outlining colors, fonts, and dimensions.

## My Process

### Built With

- Next.js with TypeScript
- TailwindCSS for styling
- ShadCN UI for reusable components
- ES Lint and Prettier for code quality
- Custom Git hooks with Commitlint
- Flexbox for layout
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

This project reinforced my understanding of responsive design principles and modern frontend workflows. Key takeaways include:

- Structuring content with semantic HTML.
- Leveraging TailwindCSS for utility-first styling.
- Integrating reusable components with ShadCN UI.
- Ensuring code quality with automated linting and formatting.

Here’s an example of code I’m particularly proud of:

```html
<div class="qr-code">
  <img src="./images/qr-code.png" alt="QR Code" />
  <p>Scan this QR code to visit Frontend Mentor!</p>
</div>
```

### Continued Development

In future projects, I aim to:

- Explore advanced component customization with ShadCN UI.
- Expand linting rules for better developer experience.
- Optimize for performance using Next.js features like ISR and SSR.
